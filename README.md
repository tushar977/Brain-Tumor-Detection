# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Brain tumor detection using CNNs involves training deep learning models on preprocessed brain MRI images. The CNN automatically learns features through convolutional layers, reducing dimensionality with pooling layers, and classifies with fully connected layers. Once trained and validated, the model aids radiologists in real-time tumor detection.
